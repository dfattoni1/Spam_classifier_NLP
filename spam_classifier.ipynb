    "The already short nature of the messages in conjunction with the reduced volume of data leads to a dataset that, while perfectly separable, is very likely not able to train a model that generalizes well to unseen data.<br><br>\n",
    "The Naive Bayes Classifier built in this project is misleadingly accurate, as it obtains perfect performance metrics even when put to the test with the validation set. The very limited access to information the model had during its training phase means that, while it might perform perfectly on this particular set of emails, longer, more complex messages with previously unseen words are very likely to throw the model off. This is especially apparent by the fact that, even with no smoothing, we were able to achieve perfect performance on all metrics in the validation set.<br><br>\n",
    "With all of this in mind, a model such as this one should not be deployed at a larger scale, as it was not designed to work that way. Unless there is access to a larger dataset that allows us to introduce more vocabulary diversity (keep in mind this model's entire training vocabulary consisted of 71 words) and longer sentences to even get context clues from higher order n-grams, it would be unwise to trust the predictions of this algorithm."
